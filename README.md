# Saurabh2907-ind-global v8.0
A modular, auditable, and globally extensible consulting-engine identity
designed by Saurabh Gangwar. This namespace anchors all Indo-Global v8.0
modules, partner adapters, quantum overlays, dashboards, and governance
artifacts.

## Core Philosophy
- Rooted in India, architected for the world.
- Every module is a symbolic handshake: transparent, auditable, and reusable.
- Built for cross-language expansion across classical and quantum ecosystems.
- Designed for community-driven growth with canonical specs and manifests.

## What Lives Under This Identity
- Universal specs for all languages (classical + quantum)
- Domain adapters: Space, Quantum, Siemens, SatelliteNetwork, Blockchain,
  Markets, Internet, Debugging v2.0, Fundraising Modules ($100B–$1T)
- Indo-Global v8.0 identity + asset adapters
- Dashboards, weighted overlays, scenario simulations, and governance systems
- Portfolio-ready artifacts for Microsoft-aligned consulting architecture
